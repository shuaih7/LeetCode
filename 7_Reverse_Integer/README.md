# Problem 7 - Reverse Integer
## Description:
Given a 32-bit signed integer, reverse digits of an integer.

## Example 1:
Input: 123
Output: 321

## Example 2:
Input: -123
Output: -321

## Example 3:
Input: 120
Output: 21

## Note:
Assume we are dealing with an environment which could only store integers within the 32-bit signed integer range: [?231,  231 ? 1]. For the purpose of this problem, assume that your function returns 0 when the reversed integer overflows.

*This problem has no result at this time since the LeetCode website will test 9 * 1000000000, which is definitely cross the limit.
